Earlier this month, I enrolled in the online Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at Flatiron School. I’ve been working in the digital media space for a while now, so technology isn’t completely new to me, but my experience has been focused on media monetization and ad sales support. My career so far has been fairly successful - I’ve worked for some cool companies, my co-workers have been some of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and I’ve learned so much from my time in the industry. So, you may be wondering, why am I looking to make a change? Why coding? Why now? To answer these questions, let’s briefly jump back in time to shed some light on how I got to this point. 


**The Early Years**

I was first introduced to computer programming in the 4th grade when my elementary school began offering an optional course in BASIC. Never one to pass up an opportunity for more school and more homework, I gladly signed up! I thought the class was super fun and I learned quite a bit. My friend and I teamed up to create a math quiz, which earned us 3rd place in our school’s Math Fair and subsequently led to an invitation to represent our school and showcase our skills at a national education conference in DC. But later that year, a change in school leadership resulted in the course being dropped and so ended my foray into computer programming.

By the time I got to high school and then college, I had moved on and found myself gravitating toward the social sciences and foreign languages. I majored in Politics, thinking I might want to go to law school or obtain a Master’s in International Relations. However, the closer I got to graduation, the less sure I was about following that path. Not wanting to rush into anything, I decided to work for a year or two to give myself more time to figure out what I wanted to do. I was hired by a small company that owned and operated minor league baseball and hockey teams and even though I knew I wasn’t destined for a career in sports management, it was fun and it paid the bills. 

More importantly, I figured out a couple of things during this time period. Working for a small company and being involved in nearly every aspect of their day-to-day operations made me consider, for the first time ever, getting a degree in business.  I simultaneously developed an interest in online media and although I wasn’t totally sure what kind of role I wanted to play, I was certain that I wanted to be a part of the industry in some way. So, when I came across an MBA program with a strong emphasis on training managers to succeed in an increasingly digital world, I thought it might be the right one for me. I was accepted, enrolled, and 2 years later, I launched the next phase of my career.

**My Life in Digital Media**

I had achieved what I set out to do. I got my foot in the door in the industry of my choice. Yay! Then, getting back to the original question, why have I chosen to study software development?

Here’s the thing. My first digital media job was in the ad sales organization of a large company and that led to more jobs within ad sales. There’s nothing wrong with advertising. I’m just not particularly passionate about it. It's also something I kind of fell into rather than a goal I actively pursued. I work mainly behind the scenes doing things like planning, forecasting, and analysis. I’m sure there are many people who would love to trade places with me, but I’ve found it to be unfulfilling. Have you ever seen the movie City Slickers? There’s a scene where Billy Crystal’s character, a radio account executive in the midst of a mid-life crisis, is lamenting the fact that his job is to “sell air”, whereas his father, an upholsterer, at least had something tangible to show for his efforts. This is how I've often felt about my own work. Sure, I’ve churned out countless Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks, but I haven’t created anything that can be enjoyed by consumers or that serves a purpose beyond a conference room or someone’s inbox.

I’ve been fortunate enough to work for some fun, cool companies that build interesting and innovative products, but I’ve always been on the periphery. Instead of focusing solely on how to monetize websites and apps, I want to be part of the team that actually brings them to life. I want to have something that I can show others and be proud of, while also knowing that real people are using and benefiting from something that I helped create.

In addition, I’ve read a number of articles lately about careers in technology that discuss the importance not only of STEM education, but also of soft skills. If you want to be successful in the field, it’s not enough to learn one or more programming languages. You need to supplement the hard tech skills with soft skills including the following:

* Communication Skills
* Problem Solving
* Teamwork/Collaboration
* Research
* Creativity

This really appealed to me for a number of reasons. Before I began researching programming, I was worried that it would entail spending the entire day in a cubicle by myself writing lines of code. As someone who enjoys a mix of solo work and teamwork, I was relieved to know there would still be ample opportunity to collaborate with colleagues. I also realized that many of the skills I had previously developed could still be useful. I wouldn’t have to throw out everything I’d done before and completely start over. Instead, I view this more as building on an existing foundation, adding new technical skills to those I've already developed, and ultimately re-orienting myself to move in a different direction that’s more focused on technology.

**Pivoting from Advertising to Coding**

Even though I’ve known for a while that I wanted to make some changes in my career, it took some time to get serious about making that happen. It didn’t make sense to enroll in a traditional degree program at this stage in my life, so I debated whether it would be worth it to enroll a bootcamp vs. trying to teach myself. I was concerned that the latter wouldn’t provide the structure I needed, so a bootcamp seemed like a better option. Even then, I kept putting it off because I thought I didn’t have the time to do it. But then a long-term contract position ended sooner than I’d expected and I found myself between jobs. Suddenly, my lack of time excuse no longer held up.

I began looking into coding bootcamps and heard about Flatiron School from my sister-in-law, who was also considering a career change and conducting her own research. I requested some info and soon after, attended the DC launch party at WeWork White House. It was a great event that left me feeling inspired and excited. There was much that impressed me, but one thing that really stood out was the sense of community. After that night, I decided to start the bootcamp prep course to get a feel for the curriculum and the online learning process.

I got through the HTML and CSS intro without too much trouble, but then came JavaScript! I quickly discovered that JavaScript is hard. Really hard. The labs were challenging and some made me question whether I could do this, but I powered through, encouraged by the fact that the course materials didn’t leave me feeling completely lost. The lessons made sense to me as I read them, so what I needed to work on was putting that knowledge into practice. Sometimes, I’d struggle with a lab, then finish the next one with ease, leading me to believe I’d finally mastered this, only to get stuck on the next one. There were definitely some ups and downs, but I felt an immense sense of accomplishment every time I solved a lab.

After I made sufficient progress in the prep course, I applied to the online software development program and started a few weeks ago. I’m currently on the Object Oriented Ruby section and approaching my first project. It was interesting to start with Ruby after beginning with JavaScript in the prep class. The concepts covered are similar, but it took a little time to get used to another new language. Labs are still challenging, but I’m getting better at understanding control flow and decoding error messages. That’s not to say there isn’t still a lot of googling and trial and error involved. Regardless of how many tries it takes, it’s immensely satisfying to start a lab with a dozen tests failing, then solve them one by one until everything comes back green, informing you that all your tests are passing.

**What’s Next?**

If my circumstances allow me to maintain my current pace, I hope to complete the program within 4-5 months. And after that? I can’t predict exactly what the future holds, but I’m excited to find out! It’s interesting to me that I’ve come back to something that I was first exposed to as a 10-year-old. If I had to do it all over again, there’s honestly not much I would change because my experiences have helped shape who I am. Life is a journey and a process and I firmly believe that we should continue to grow, learn, and explore new things for as long as we can.
